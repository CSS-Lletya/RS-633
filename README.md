The current state of this development is by no means hostable or remotely close to being playable. Various things need to be updated, and changed to ensure proper functionality during development.
Please consider helping the development to help bring new life to a revision that hasn't seen the light of day.

# Goals for RS-633?
The main goal is to obtain full funtionality for gameplay. This will take quite some time, however will be more than worth the effort.
Should development succeed in obtaining the basic functionality and gameplay is 'smooth' then a live server will be hosted 24/7.
In addition, fixing where matrix went wrong (that list is far too big) we should be aiming towards re-writing majority of what exists.

# Original Thread owner's notes
- Disabled lobby (can be enabled easily)
- Disabled issac (can be enabled easily)
- Converted Matrix for reference
- Conversion is not 100% complete as a lot of packets and other things are missing. The server is not in a state to be hosted.
